Want to run this
First install the Node js 
Second install the json server "npm i -g json-server"
After then, run the server in terminal " json-server <NameFile>.json " 
right here is "json-server ex1-database.json"
Go live and chilll the exercise

// NOTE
To run the file error-free, focus on opening the correct folder to avoid directory (cd) errors.
Bc When I code this I only open the folder I don't have check the general so maybe it will be have a problem if you run this in folder general
